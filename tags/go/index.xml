      <description>It looks like all tech blogs need to start with posts about how the blog was built. So here goes.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the footer I decided to go with Hugo to create my blog, it seemed fairly easy and created a static site that I can run on github pages or AWS S3. A recurring theme on this blog will probably be how terrible I am as a developer so this is really a must have feature.</description>
